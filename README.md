# logistic_regression_model_test_ml_workflow

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow using Python and Pandas. It covers:

- Creating and cleaning a dataset
- Generating new features
- Filtering, aggregating, and ranking data
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Training a Logistic Regression model for multi-class classification
- Evaluating model performance with accuracy and classification reports

**Note:** The dataset is randomly generated for practice purposes. Accuracy will be low because there are no real patterns in the data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
